# Orion
Orion is a JOGL graphics engine. The long term plan for Orion is to interactively render galaxies with countless stars, nebulae, planets and other bodies. The current plan is to use this codebase for researching and implementing an approach for rendering volumetric and surface data interactively while creating the illusion of unlimited scale.

We support the following:
- Basic linear algebra
- Rendering:
 - Meshes
 - Lines
 - Cubes
 - Volumes
- Shaders with GLSL
- A basic scene graph
- GL level tracing and debugging
- A basic asset management system

## Building Orion
Orion is built with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/):

- Download and install Gradle.
- Run 'gradle assembleDist' to built the distributable.

## Developer Environment

- We recommend working in the [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/) with Gradle integration.
- We recommend [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) as a visual Git tool.
